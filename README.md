### 🔭 Currently Working On
- **GVM (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager)**: Automating secure, isolated deployments for vulnerability scanning in air-gapped labs.
- **Network Recon Toolkit**: Python-based automation for Nmap, DNS enumeration, and OSINT — strictly for authorized testing.
- **Educational Malware Analysis**: Studying input monitoring, file infection, and process behavior in controlled VM environments.

### 🌱 Learning & Exploring
- Advanced cryptography implementations in Python
- Dockerized security tooling (GVM, Bettercap, custom scanners)
- Web application hardening (HSTS, CSP, secure headers on Nginx/Apache)
